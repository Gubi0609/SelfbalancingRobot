# Selfbalancing Robot
This project aspires to develop a self balancing robot using an ESP32 and to be able to move the robot using a controller.

## Project Goals
- To have a self balancing robot that uses an IMU to estimate its position.
- To use Kalman Filter and PID controll on an ESP32 to accurately balance.
- To have an external controller, that the user can use to move and controll the robot.

### Nice to haves
- Eyes on robot accomplished by two OLED displays
- A stylish exterior for the robot
- A rechargeable battery and accompanying protection circuit
- A custom PCB to house all the electronics

## Learning Goals
- Kalman filter
- PID controll
- ESP32 wireless communication protocol
- Power circuit for motors and ESP32
- Battery protection circuit
